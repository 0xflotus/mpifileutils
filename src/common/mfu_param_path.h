/* Collective routine called "mfu_param_path_set" to process input
 * paths specified by the user.  This routine takes a path as a string,
 * processes it in different ways, and fills in a data structure.
 *
 * The data structure contains a copy of the original string as
 * specified by the user (orig), a standardized version (path) that
 * uses an absolute path and removes things like ".", "..", consecutive
 * and trailing '/' chars, and finally a version that resolves any
 * symlinks (target).  For path and target, it also executes and
 * records the stat info corresponding to those paths (path_stat and
 * target_stat), and there is a flag set to 0 or 1 to indicate whether
 * the stat fields are valid (path_stat_valid and target_stat_valid).
 *
 * To avoid hitting the file system with a bunch of redundant stat
 * calls, only rank 0 executes the stat calls, and it broadcasts the
 * results to all other ranks in the job.
 *
 * After calling mfu_param_path_set, you must eventually call
 * mfu_param_path_free to release resources allocated in
 * mfu_param_path_set. */
